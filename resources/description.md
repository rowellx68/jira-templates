➼ Features

• Per project and per issue type templates
• Navigable placeholders within templates
• Automatically apply templates when changing issue type
• Shareable configuration

➼ Permissions

• "Access browser tabs" - required to check if the current tab is one of the domains to which the templates could be applied to
• "Access your data for all web sites" - required to be able to target Jira Cloud and on premises installations of Jira

➼ Help and Support

Some documentation can be found on the homepage listed here.
